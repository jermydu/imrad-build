# ImRAD

ImRAD is a GUI builder for the ImGui library. It generates and parses C++ code which can be directly used in your application.  

ImRAD runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

# Features

ImRAD is under active development but these are the main features:

* supports designing all kinds of windows
  * Floating windows, popups and modal popups. These are ImGui backend independent
  * MainWindow with GLFW integration. ImRAD generates GLFW calls which will synchronize ImGui window with its OS window (title bar, resizability flags, autosize etc.)
  * Activity. This is a undecorated window which fills the entire viewport area. Only one activity can be shown at the time. Used mainly for Android apps  
  * contains a GLFW template for generating generic `main.cpp`
  * contains an android template for generating generic `MainActivity.java`+`manifest`+`main.cpp`
  
* supports wide range of widgets
  
  * basic widgets like `Text`, `Checkbox`, `Combo`, `Button`, `Slider`, `ColorEdit` etc.
  * container widgets like `Child`, `Table`, `CollapsingHeader`, `TreeNode`, `TabBar`,
  * more exotic widgets such as `Splitter`
  * `MenuBar` and context menu editing
  * `CustomWidget` (a placeholder to user code)

* generates layout using `SameLine`/`Spacing`/`NextColumn`/`BeginGroup` instead of absolute positioning 
  
  * This ensures widgets respect item spacing and frame padding in a consistent way
  * There is a clear relationship between parent - child widget as well as children ordering which is important for container widgets like Table
  * Overlay widgets can be placed on top using relative position to the nearest window corner

* supports property binding 
  
  * class variables can be managed through simple class wizard or from binding dialog
  * property binding is important because ImGui is immediate mode GUI library so widget states like input text or combobox items must be set at the time of drawing from within the generated code. 
  * using property binding generated UI becomes dynamic and yet it can still be designed at the same time  

* supports generating event handlers and other support code
  
  * for example modal dialog will generate `OpenPopup` member function with a lambda callback called when dialog is closed
  * event handlers allow event handling user code to be separated from the generated part so the designer still works

* generated code is delimited by comment markers and user is free to add additional code around and continue to use ImRAD at the same time
  
  * this can be used to call dependent popup Draw calls or to calculate some variables
  * it is also possible to use `CustomWidget` which will just call to a user code callback

* target window style is fully configurable
  * apart from default styles provided by ImGui user can define new style and save it as an INI file under the `style` folder. Colors, style variables and used fonts can all be configured.
  * ImRAD will follow style settings when designing your UI
  * stored style can be loaded in your app by using simple `imrad.h` function  

* generated code is ready to use in your project and depends only on ImGui library and one accompanying header file (imrad.h)

  * some features such as MainWindow or Image widget require GLFW dependency. Compile your code with `IMRAD_WITH_GLFW` to activate it
  * currently Image widget requires stb library as well. Compile your code with `IMRAD_WITH_STB` or supply your own `LoadTextureFromFile()`
  * optional support for the popular `fmt` library can be activated by defining `IMRAD_WITH_FMT`. This will allow you to use formating flags throughout all string properties  

* ImRAD tracks changes to the opened files so files can be designed in ImRAD and edited in your IDE of choice at the same time
  
  * maybe the auto-save feature would be useful to have 

# License

* ImRAD source code is licensed under the GPL license 
* Any code generated by the tool is excluded from GPL and can be included in any project either open-source or commercial and it's up to the user to decide the license for it. 
* Additionally since `imrad.h` is used by the generated code it is also excluded from the GPL license  

# Download binaries

for up-to date version clone & build the repository using CMake. 

Somewhat older version can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/tpecholt/imrad/releases)

# How to build

## Windows
1. Use CMake GUI to configure and generate sln file
2. Open the generated sln file in Visual Studio 2017 or newer (you can use Express or Community editions which are downloadable for free)
3. Build the INSTALL project in Release mode. It may require running VS with admin rights
4. If you didn't alter CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable ImRAD will be installed into *C:\Program Files\imrad\latest*

## Linux
1. Run the provided installation script (script parameter is the ImRAD version you want to name the folder) 

   ```sudo ./release-linux 0.5```

2. ImRAD will be installed into *./install/imrad-0.5*

# How to debug
   
## Windows

1. Build the INSTALL target in VS as described above
2. Set imrad as startup project, set its working directory to the installed folder
3. Debug & Run
